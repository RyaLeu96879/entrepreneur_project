            case came from the idea of a thermal powered flashlight. This product 
            was made by Ann Makosinski, a female inventor who created the thermal 
            powered flashlight using peltier tiles. She discovered in an article
            about her achievements, that these peltier tiles were capable of turning
            the heat from the human hand into electrical energy that can be used for
            technology. Because of this, we decide to use peltier tiles as the way 
            energy will be created. In addition to this, after we were done brainstorming
            ideas, we came across the idea of having that energy stored for use instead
            of use directly charging the device. We thought of this mainly because we 
            thought that the energy made by the hand wouldn’t be able to charge the phone 
            for a long period of time. So, we incorporated a lithium ion battery into our
            design for the energy made to be used when the user wants to use it. After
            fixing this problem, we brainstormed what we would make this specifically
            for, such as phones, laptops, earbuds, etc. After some research on what type
            of digital device is used most often by youths and millennials, we found that
            smartphones were used most often. This lead to our decision that we would create a case to create and store energy. 
            After we thought of the basis of our design and function of our product, we looked 
            into solutions that other people made to try to solve this issue. Our first thought 
            were portable chargers because this product has risen in popularity in these years. 
            We looked into why this product was so valuable, and we came across the reason that we
            had, to prevent your device from dying. Because of a portable chargers abnormally large
            battery, it allows for the user to charge their devices multiple times to full. However,
            even though the amount portable chargers can store is large, it still has a limit.
            Because of this, it does have a limited amount of times it can charge a device. 
            It also isn’t able to charge quickly because of its large battery, making the charging process time consuming.
            In addition, another solution that we saw was public outlets. This solution
            made charging devices available for anyone because they can be placed in specific
            areas where people are located. Because of this, people with digital devices are
            able to charge their devices fully as many time as they want because the energy 
            is free or all. Despite this, there are still drawbacks the availability of these
            outlets in public. With the rise of technologies importance in society, many people
            have access to technology now. Due to this rise, more people are using these outlets
            to charge their device, meaning that these outlet are all being used, and unlucky people are incapable of using them.
