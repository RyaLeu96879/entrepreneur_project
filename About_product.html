            <p>When your outside your home, in a mall, a park, at work, at school, 
            etc, you usually have your smartphone with you. You text, you tweet,
            or do something on an application that you have but then you notice that
            your battery is running low, and you need to charge your device. You 
            look in your bag for your portable charger, but it is empty because 
            you had to charge it. You then look for a public outlet 
            that you could use, but you see other people crowding over the outlets
            because they have to charge their devices too. What do you do now that
            your phone is dying and you don’t have anything to charge your device?</p>
            <br></br>
            <font color="black"><p><u>Solution</u></p>
            <p>Our final product for this project is a device that allows for energy 
            made by an individual's hand to be stored into a battery for the users purposes.
            This product is roughly over 15 mm thick, making the size comparable to 
            twice the case of a smartphone. The product also is roughly ⅔ the length
            of a smartphone case and is a little smaller than the width of the smartphone.
            As for the design, we decided that the all the components that allow the 
            product to function will be in one holder/divider part. This part keeps the 
            battery, wires, peltier tiles, and other parts away from each other.</p>
