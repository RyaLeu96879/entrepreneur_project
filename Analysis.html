            <font color="black"><p><center>After we finished modeling the phone case in 
            Autodesk inventor, we decided to create a life size model of our product 
            using cardboard and tape. We mainly focused on the overall details of 
            the the product, which are the phone case and the part that holds the 
            battery and the peltier tiles. After we cut out and taped the pieces 
            together, we looked at how big the whole product would be. It appeared
            to be fairly slim, having the whole thickness of both parts being 
            around one inch. Also, we added some details to the product, such as 
            outlining the peltier tiles shape so we could see how much of the tiles
            is covered by the hands. When we did this analysis, we observed that 
            most of the area for the peltier tiles are covered by the fingers, 
            mainly the first and second section of the fingers. However, the peltier 
            tiles did not have that much contact with the ends of the fingers. This
            leads us to believe that we should create more models for left and right
            handed people so that more energy can be created depending on what hand 
            is dominant. In addition, we also discovered that the peltier tiles can be 
            laid on the palm of the users hand. The importance of this is that the palm
            of the hand creates more heat, so more energy can be made this way. The 
            overall design of the case is fine, being able to fit in someone's hand 
            and with the added feature of being detachable, this product can create 
            energy and be a regular phone case. Future improvements to this product 
            would be to make the product more compact, finding less expensive peltier 
            tiles, having a wider variety of case, finding a bigger battery that has
            similar dimensions, and minor design fixes.</center>
